Banks analyze there loans in several ways to minimize credit risk, one of them is loans cycle / loans classification / loans movement analysis.

- Loans Aging: This refers to categorizing loans based on how long they have been outstanding. Banks divide loans into different time periods or "buckets" to see which loans are due for repayment soon and which ones have been outstanding for a longer time.

- Loans Classification: Banks classify loans into different categories based on their level of risk. For example, they may classify loans as "low risk," "medium risk," or "high risk" based on factors like the borrower's credit history, income, and the purpose of the loan. This helps banks understand the overall riskiness of their loan portfolio.

- Loans Movement Analysis: This involves tracking how loans move or change categories over time. Banks monitor whether loans are moving from one risk category to another or from one aging bucket to another. By analyzing these movements, they can identify trends and potential risks.
  
The goal of these analyses is to gain insights into the bank's loan portfolio. By understanding the aging of loans, banks can identify which loans are becoming overdue and take appropriate actions. Similarly, by analyzing loan classifications and movements, banks can assess the quality of their loans and make informed decisions about lending practices.

### In these analysis, we will try to make sense of data using aging buckets, and how loans move from one bucket to another, as periods change.
